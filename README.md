# Open-cv-mini-projects
This repo contains some opencv mini projects which I have made alongside doing a Udemy course on mastering opencv 

The first file namely getting_landmarks file will helps us to get landmarks of out face features.

The second file namely position for both lips appended is helping us to get the upper and lower lip positions

The main function detects whether or not the mouth is open by checking the distance between the upper and lower lips

Also the image I have attached is the landmarks image for the full face 

I have followed the udemy course of mastering computer vision opencv in python with deep learning while writing the codes
