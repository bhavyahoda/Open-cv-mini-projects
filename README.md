# Open-cv-mini-projects
This repo contains some opencv mini projects which I have made alongside doing a Udemy course on mastering opencv

I have followed the udemy course of mastering computer vision opencv in python with deep learning while writing the codes
And the codes are written by me while understanding the concepts from both the course and opencv official documentation.
